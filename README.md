In the last couple of weeks, hundreds of engineers and hobbyists were coming up with creative solutions to help to fight COVID-19 and save human lives. We also tried to come up with safe alternatives and we would like to share our conclusions, which might be useful for others: [https://reka-berci-hajnovics.github.io/open-ventilator/](https://reka-berci-hajnovics.github.io/open-ventilator/)

## Recommendation ##

**For COVID-19 patients pressure control mode should be used instead of the volume control to protect lungs. If the patient has spontaneous breathing APRV or bilevel or CPAP methods are the most lung-protective modes.
When the patient has no breathing a medical ventilator should be used. When the patient has spontaneous breathing can be ventilated using a CPAP machine or an air pump system developed by TU Delft. 
Note: The CPAP machines need to have a filter to avoid ventilating the virus into the air. 
Note: The device developed by TU Delft is in the phase of clinical testing, as soon as it passes the tests, all the necessary files will be shared on their [website.](https://www.operationair.org/)**
